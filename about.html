						<h5>How do you develop a really good Project Execution Plan (PEP)  with all Stakeholders & Team members?</h5>
                        <p>
							Develop a Project Execution Plan with your project team based on what you have learned, what you developed from execution philosophy and strategy development (see my previous blog post) that will match to the maximum possible extent the customer’s culture, personalities, organization, work practices, etc whilst delivering the project scope and deliverables to match or exceed the stakeholder's expectations and deliver the project performance (including financial) required by your organisation. 
                        <br>Use the execution planning phase and time to build both internal and external relationships with your project team, external stakeholders (especially the customer's team) 
                    <br> Convey your project execution strategy to your team and stakeholders.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy, or fine-tune it, as you gain experience with them and build an understanding of their needs.</p>

                    <h5>Customer Relationship</h5>

                       <p> Determining the customer’s expectations of your organisation is as important as determining what the written scope of work/services document (usually an attachment to the contract and also found in the Invitation to Bid package) and can help to frame your PEP.  What is not written can be just as important as what is written, sometimes more so.</p>
				<p>Learn as much as possible about your customer’s executive management.  You will undoubtedly have had contact with them during the proposal phase and probably intense discussions as the project was awarded/kicked off and moves into the execution phase.</p>
                <p>Tip-off your own management about the executives they will be dealing with so that your management can prepare their own strategy.  Develop a customer relationship plan (sometimes called a zippering plan) from Project Leads up to the highest level</p>
                <p>Use the planning process to establish an open, business-like but collaborative execution approach from the start. Be absolutely certain that you and your team always maintain good communications, even if it is bad news.  Stakeholders both external (including the customer) and internal hate surprises.  Knowing and understanding the behavioural characteristics of the people you are dealing with is a key factor in the execution strategy and PEP.</p>
                <p>Be honest.  Be open.  Develop trust.  Understand your counterparts’ (customer's Project Director or Manager) stature with his or her management.  Design your PEP and manage expectations in a way to help make your counterpart successful and look good to their management—but do not sacrifice your own organisation in the process.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<blockquote class="generic-blockquote">
							1️⃣ Write down your project goals and scope and agree them with the key stakeholders (client, your project sponsor, permitting authorities….)

<br>
2️⃣ Develop a project team organization and identify key resources needed (some key specialist expertise perhaps).
<br>

3️⃣ Breakdown the project scope into tasks and deliverables, develop a project timeline (schedule).

<br>
4️⃣ Develop assumptions and key risks to successful execution of the project.

<br>
5️⃣ Develop and document a project cost estimate and agree a control budget with relevant stakeholders.
